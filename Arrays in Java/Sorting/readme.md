## 📜 Implemented Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**  
   A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
   **Complexity**: O(n²)  
   [View Implementation](https://github.com/ankushgandhi1706/Java-OOPS-DSA/blob/main/Arrays%20in%20Java/Sorting/BubbleSort.java)

2. **Selection Sort**  
   An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: sorted and unsorted.  
   **Complexity**: O(n²)  
   [View Implementation](https://github.com/ankushgandhi1706/Java-OOPS-DSA/blob/main/Arrays%20in%20Java/Sorting/SelecionSort.java)

3. **Insertion Sort**  
   Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly inserting unsorted elements into their correct position.  
   **Complexity**: O(n²)  
   [View Implementation](https://github.com/ankushgandhi1706/Java-OOPS-DSA/blob/main/Arrays%20in%20Java/Sorting/InsertionSort.java)

4. **Merge Sort**  
   A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them.  
   **Complexity**: O(n log n)  
   [View Implementation](https://github.com/ankushgandhi1706/Java-OOPS-DSA/blob/main/Arrays%20in%20Java/Sorting/MergeSort.java)

5. **Quick Sort**  
   Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array based on a pivot element.  
   **Complexity**: O(n log n)  
   [View Implementation](https://github.com/ankushgandhi1706/Java-OOPS-DSA/blob/main/Arrays%20in%20Java/Sorting/QuickSort.java)

6. **Heap Sort**  
   Utilizes a binary heap structure to sort elements efficiently.  
   **Complexity**: O(n log n)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)

7. **Cycle Sort**  
    An in-place, non-comparison sorting algorithm that minimizes the number of writes to the array by rotating elements to their correct positions.  
    **Complexity**: O(n²)  
    [View Implementation](https://github.com/ankushgandhi1706/Java-OOPS-DSA/blob/main/Arrays%20in%20Java/Sorting/CycleSort.java)
