## 📜 Implemented Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**  
   A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
   **Complexity**: O(n²)  
   [View Implementation](Arrays in Java/Sorting/BubbleSort.java)

2. **Selection Sort**  
   An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: sorted and unsorted.  
   **Complexity**: O(n²)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)

3. **Insertion Sort**  
   Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly inserting unsorted elements into their correct position.  
   **Complexity**: O(n²)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)

4. **Merge Sort**  
   A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them.  
   **Complexity**: O(n log n)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)

5. **Quick Sort**  
   Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array based on a pivot element.  
   **Complexity**: O(n log n)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)

6. **Heap Sort**  
   Utilizes a binary heap structure to sort elements efficiently.  
   **Complexity**: O(n log n)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)

7. **Counting Sort**  
   A non-comparison-based algorithm suitable for sorting integers or objects within a limited range.  
   **Complexity**: O(n + k)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)

8. **Radix Sort**  
   A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that processes digits individually starting from the least significant digit.  
   **Complexity**: O(nk)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)

9. **Bucket Sort**  
   Distributes elements into buckets and sorts them individually.  
   **Complexity**: O(n + k)  
   [View Implementation](link-to-file)
