# ArrayList Module

This folder contains examples, explanations, and problem-solving implementations using the `ArrayList` class in Java. It is part of the **Java-OOPS-DSA** repository, which focuses on Java-based Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) concepts and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

## Contents
- **Basics of ArrayList**  
  - Creating and initializing an `ArrayList`  
  - Adding, accessing, updating, and removing elements  
  - Using loops to iterate through the list  
- **Advanced Operations**  
  - Sorting an `ArrayList` using `Collections.sort`  
  - Searching for elements using `contains` or custom logic  
  - Cloning and copying lists  
  - Converting an `ArrayList` to arrays and vice versa  
- **Problem-Solving with ArrayLists**  
  - Examples of solving coding problems involving dynamic arrays  
  - Techniques like merging multiple lists, removing duplicates, and handling multidimensional lists  

## Prerequisites
To understand the examples in this module, you should be familiar with:  
- Basic Java syntax  
- Concepts of OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)  
- Java Collections Framework
