# Searching in Arrays (Java)

This folder contains Java implementations of various array searching algorithms, essential for mastering data structures and algorithmic problem-solving.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

1. **Linear Search**  
   - Simple and straightforward search algorithm.  
   - Best for small or unsorted arrays.  
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)

2. **Binary Search**  
   - Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays.  
   - **Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
   - Includes iterative and recursive implementations.

3. **Some Searching based problems**
